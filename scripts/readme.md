# Scripts Readme

## Introduction

These are general scripts that can be run to do basic setups and installations.  It is **important** to note that none of the scripts in this folder should expect a fully configured PowerShell environment, PowerShell profile, or expect any PowerShell modules that don't come as standard in a PowerShell environment.

Furthermore, these scripts are expected to work on Windows only and most require being run in an Administrative shell.
